# Simple-Browser

This is a simple project that will only get updated once a year (23H2, 24H2, etc.).

This used to be used on our servers.

**Requires**: Windows 10 22H2 <sub><sup>(The last version of Windows 10)</sub></sup>
          
  or  Windows 11 21H2 <sub><sup>(or the May 2021 Dev Leak)</sub></sup> or later
